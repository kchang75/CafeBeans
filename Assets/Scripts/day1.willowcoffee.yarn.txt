PC: Here's your coffee. 5 regular black coffees and 1 black with vanilla syrup.
Willow: Oh thank you.
She takes a quick sip of her coffee and a slight smile appears on her face. 
This might be my chance to investigate, she might be willing to reveal more if she's in a good mood. 
PC: Would it be possible for you to stay and chat for a bit? It gets awfully lonely in here sometimes.
Willow: I have to get back to work, but a few minutes couldn't hurt. I don't particularly mind being away from that place either. 
Let's start simple and harmless. 
PC: How has work been going?
Willow: Oh you know, the same as always.
As yes how very insightful and intriguing, just what I wanted to hear.
"The same as always.", a single phrase that provides the minimum amount of detail and shuts down any further socially acceptable inquiry.
It could mean anything from "I love my job and everything's great" to "I hate my coworkers so much that every Wednesday night I sneak around back-alleys finding unsuspecting women so I can rip their faces open in order to relieve my stress."
And any more probing would prove pushy, rude, and awkward. 

->Define same as always.
	Willow: Not great, not terrible. Just something you have to do. 
	[[Does it stress you out?||stress]]
	[[Is it hard being an intern?||intern]]
->How are you doing today?
	Willow: Alright.

Willow: "All jobs are stressful in some way or another. It's nothing I can't handle."

->What are your coworkers like?
	Seeing that all the victims are female and around Willow's age, maybe she has problems with a female coworker who the victims remind her of. 
	Willow: They're fine. They all have decent work ethics and know what they're doing.
	[[So...not great, huh?|great]]
	[[Do you have any friends there?||friends]]
	[[How do they treat you? Must be tough being the new guy.||noob]]
->What is your boss like
	Willow: ...Tolerable.

Willow: Sometimes. As I'm the lowest there, others sometimes give me tasks which no one else wants to do.
