title: Start
---

The familiar bell of the door opening breaks me out of my spiraling thoughts.
With a feeling of dread far greater than any I had ever experienced I realize it's one of my regulars.

<<setsprite Willow neutral>>
Willow: Good morning.

-> Silence
	<<setsprite Willow angry>>
	Willow: I said... good morning.
	PC: A-ah good morning Willow. Sorry, I just didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
	Willow: Oh don't worry about it, I understand. Running this place all by yourself must be a lot of work. Being your own boss comes with its downsides doesn't it?
	PC: Haha, yeah... Anyway what can I get you?
-> Good morning
	PC: What can I get you today?

<<setsprite Willow neutral>>
Willow: Could I have a single black coffee with vanilla syrup and five regular black coffees?
PC: Of course, I'll get right on that.

<<setsprite Willow grayed>>
Willow is an intern at a local business office a few blocks down and as the lowest on the totem pole, her boss sends her to buy coffee for the office every morning.
She seems... so normal, could she be possible of such a monstrosity? Would the polite and professional Willow that I know brutally maim someone until they were unrecognizable?
Well I guess the truth is, I don't really know her. I might know her name, workplace, and general disposition, but I don't know what makes her tick.
I don't know what causes her stress in her everyday life, I don't know how she views other people, and I don't know the depths of her hatred.
I don't truly know any of my regulars, but if I want to catch this psychopath I'm going to need to find out.
But I have to be careful in how I act. If this killer is as dangerous as I think they are, there's no telling how any one of my actions could affect them, or end up coming back to haunt me.
