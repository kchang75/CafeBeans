<<setsprite Gwen happy>>
Gwen: Hey there, my name is Gwen. And what would yours be, cutie?
"Aren’t you in middle school? That’s a bit too young to be flirting with your local barista."

<<setsprite Gwen angry>>
Gwen: Hey! I’m a high school senior ok?! Can’t you tell? 

<<setsprite Gwen sad>>
Gwen: Why does everyone think I’m in middle school? Is the makeup not working? Ugh I hate this!
"Um, you know I was just kidding right?" 

<<setsprite Gwen surprised>>
Gwen: Oh. Psh of course I knew.

<<setsprite Gwen neutral>>
Gwen:  Anyways, I want a Venti Iced Skinny Hazelnut Macchiato, Sugar-Free Syrup, Extra Shot, Light Ice, No Whip.

<<setsprite Gwen angry>>
Gwen: And make it fast cuz I gotta go to school for cheer practice before class.
Gwen: I’ve gone to about every other coffee shop around town and they never get my order right.
Gwen: And I’ve been going too cranky to school due to my lack of caffeine just because of this mistake. So, hurry. 

<<setsprite Gwen surprised>>
Gwen: Oh, wow you actually got it exactly how I ordered!
Gwen: I usually have to talk to the manager at most coffee shops because their employees never get it right!
Gwen: Like come on it’s not that hard!! 

<<setsprite Gwen happy>>
Gwen: Anyways I think I found my new favorite place!

<<setsprite Mike neutral>>
Mike: Mornin'.
Mike: This place seems new. Is it?

<<setsprite Mike happy>>
Mike: Wow, well, welcome to the neighborhood.

<<setsprite Mike surprised>>
Mike: Oh right! My order...

<<setsprite Mike neutral>>
Mike: Could I get a black tea latte? Thanks.
Mike: Uh... so, I noticed you have a beetle problem with the flowers out front...
Mike: They're pretty damaging pests in the garden. I could take them off your hands for you... free of charge.

"Uh... Sure, why not?"

<<setsprite Mike happy>>
Mike: Awesome!
Mike: Y'know, beetles are the largest order of animals, protocoleptera fossil records say...

<<setsprite Mike neutral>>
Mike: Uh...

<<setsprite Mike sad>>
Mike: I'll stop myself before I start rambling.

<<setsprite Mike neutral>>
Mike: Just the drink please.

"Here you go. Enjoy your latte!"

Mike: ...

<<setsprite Mike happy>>
Mike: Thanks, you too!

<<setsprite Mike neutral>>
Mike: ...

<<setsprite Mike angry>>
Mike: Wait. Shit...

Richard: Good morning. One black coffee with three expresso shots please. 
Richard: I know that's a lot. It was a long night yesterday and it's going to be a long day today. Got an engineering exam at 2:00. 
"You're a bit late today. Did your 8:00 am class get cancelled?""

<<setsprite Richard happy>>
Richard: Just between you and me... I skipped. I know I shouldn't, but it feels so good.
Richard: Just throwing away my responsibilities and sleeping. It's one of the only things that makes me feel real joy anymore. 

<<setsprite Richard sad>>
Richard: The workload is just too much, every single waking moment is spent on school somehow.
Richard: I can say that I'm one of the most hardworking people in the department, but it's just burnt me out.
Richard: The mere sight of that accursed engineering textbook ruins my whole day. 

<<setsprite Richard angry>>
Richard: A bit of it is my fault. I'm a perfectionist so things take twice as long as they should.
Richard: But I can't help it. My parents cursed me to be this way. Always pushing me to do better and my best was never enough.
Richard: My life would've been so much easier if they had just been... normal.

<<setsprite Richard neutral>>
Richard: But I guess it's a blessing and a curse.
Richard: It takes so much out of me but I'm more successful than everyone else. 
"Here you go. Three expresso shots, be careful, it's..."

<<setsprite Richard suprised>>
Richard: Ah! Ouch!
"...hot."

<<setsprite Richard neutral>>

<<setsprite Willow neutral>>
Willow: Hi, 11 black coffees; one with vanilla cream and 2 shots of espresso.
"That’s more espresso than you usually get. Another late night?"

<<setsprite Willow sad>>
Willow: Yeah, the boss dropped a workload on me last minute.
Willow: I was up ‘till 4:30 at the office last night getting all of his work done.

<<setsprite Willow angry>>
Willow: I swear I do so much for this company and don’t get the pay for it.
Willow: It feels like they lowered the pay just for me since I’m only part-time.

<<setsprite Willow sad>>
Willow: It’s been a bit tough the past few days, there seems to be no end in sight for the busy work they keep assigning me.

<<setsprite Willow neutral>>
Willow: I’m just glad I don’t have to wait much longer to see the Jefferson’s kids.

<<setsprite Willow happy>>
Willow: It feels like it’s been forever since I last saw them. I’m so excited to show them the new games I’ll bring when I babysit them!
"Here’s your order, would you like help this time getting all of this to your car?"

<<setsprite Willow neutral>>
Willow: Nah, I think I’m getting the hang of this. But thanks for the offer.

<<setsprite Willow suprised>>
Willow: Oh shoot, I’m gonna be late. Gotta go, see ya tomorrow!

<<setsprite Willow neutral>>
